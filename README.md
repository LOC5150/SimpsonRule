# SimpsonRule
Just a basic code to calc Simpson rule 
This was an assignment in Comp Physics for the simpson rule
You basically just plug in the boundaries and the integral with n being number of intervals
We had to graph and shade after it was calculated.
If you can give any tips for improving the calculation it would be much appreciated.
